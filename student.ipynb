If we look at our statistical data from using the `.describe()` function, we can see that the `mean` year renovated is `86.64` which does not make much sense. Our `median` is listed as `0` which also does not help us. Next, we may consider using the `mode`. "

    "We know when we need to transform a categorical variable for regression models, there are two approaches:\n",
    "1) Perform label encoding<br>\n",
    "2) Create dummy variables / one-hot-encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding consists of converting each value in a column to a number. This is one method for transforming a categorical variable into a numeric one so that our models can make sense of the values in the column. That being said, we will create dummy variables below. The advantage of this is that our numerical values cannot be misinterpreted as being continuous. We know one-hot-encoding is required when adding categorical variables in a regression model. One thing to be mindful of is the dummy variable trap where one variable can be predicted from all of this others. This would result in multicollinearity which is an issue in regression. We will avoid this trap by dropping one of the dummy variables by passing `drop_first = True` to our function `get_dummies()` from the `pandas` library."
